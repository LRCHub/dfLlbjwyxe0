[00:04.59] "I killed someone yesterday."
[00:06.84] You said that.
[00:09.50] Soaked to the bone during the rainy season, I was crying right in front of my room.
[00:15.23] Summer has only just begun, yet...
[00:17.84] You were shaking terribly.
[00:19.99] That's how the story begins. It's a memory from that summer day.
[00:49.58] The one I killed was the guy in the next seat who always bullied me.
[00:54.95] Fed up, I shoved him away,
[00:57.69] It was just bad luck.
[01:00.34] I don't think I can stay here any longer,
[01:02.97] I'll go die somewhere far away.
[01:05.67] I said to you like that.
[01:08.35] "Then take me with you."
[01:10.63] Carry a wallet, carry a knife,
[01:13.65] Pack your handheld games in your bag,
[01:16.65] Let's break everything we don't need.
[01:21.91] That photo, that diary,
[01:24.37] I don't need it anymore now.
[01:27.37] A journey with a murderer and you, a good-for-nothing—me and you.
[01:37.92] And we ran away.
[01:40.39] From this narrow, narrow world.
[01:42.96] I'll leave everything behind—my family, my classmates, everything—just you and me.
[01:48.62] Let's die together in a place far, far away where no one else is.
[01:53.04] There's no value left in this world anymore.
[01:55.92] Murderers are popping up everywhere, aren't they?
[01:59.47] You're not at fault. You're not at fault.
[02:20.60] In the end, none of us had ever been loved by anyone.
[02:25.39] We've trusted each other so easily because of that unpleasant commonality.
[02:31.10] When I held your hand, even the faint tremor had already vanished,
[02:36.32] Unbound by anyone, the two of us walked along the railroad tracks.
[02:41.63] Steal the money and run away together,
[02:44.68] I felt like I could go anywhere.
[02:47.06] There was nothing left to fear for us now.
[02:52.34] The sweat on my forehead, the glasses that slipped off
[02:55.01] "It doesn't matter anymore now."
[02:57.70] A small escapade for the outcast.
[03:08.63] If I were the kind protagonist I once dreamed of—gentle and beloved by all—
[03:13.79] Will you still save us, even though we've become so dirty?
[03:19.05] "I gave up on that dream, you know? Because come on, face reality?"
[03:23.03] There was no such thing as the four-letter word "happiness"
[03:26.31] Haven't you learned that lesson hard enough in your life so far?
[03:29.72] Everyone must think they're not at fault.
[03:51.19] A swarm of cicadas wandering aimlessly,
[03:54.07] With no water left and my vision beginning to blur,
[03:56.45] Amid the raging demons' furious shouts,
[03:59.04] Acting like fools, frolicking together
[04:00.81] Suddenly, you took the knife.
[04:03.16] Because you've been by my side all this time, I've been able to get this far.
[04:07.41] It's okay now. It's okay now.
[04:09.78] "It's fine if only I die."
[04:21.77] And you cut your own throat.
[04:24.18] It's like a scene from some movie.
[04:27.45] I felt as if I were having a daydream.
[04:29.78] Before I knew it, I was caught.
[04:32.13] I couldn't find you anywhere.
[04:35.55] Only you are nowhere to be found.
[04:37.87] And time passed.
[04:40.11] Just hot, hot days passed by.
[04:43.25] Even though my family and the guys in my class are here
[04:45.86] For some reason, you alone are nowhere to be found.
[04:48.23] I remember that summer day.
[04:50.88] I'm still singing even now.
[04:53.54] I've been searching for you all this time.
[04:56.59] I have something I want to tell you.
[04:59.13] At the end of September, I sneezed.
[05:01.54] The scent of June lingers.
[05:04.29] Your smile, your innocence, fills my mind to overflowing.
[05:09.55] Nobody's to blame.
[05:12.24] You're not at fault, so it's okay. Just give up.
[05:17.83] Did you want me to say that? Huh?
